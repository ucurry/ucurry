# The Âµcurry Compiler

Coded in OCaml, this compiler takes a minimal functional language and compiles 
it down to LLVM IR. The compiler now only supports scanning and parsing.

## How to compile and execute

In the toplevel directory, run `dune build` to build the compiler. 
Run `dune exec ucurry -- -a` to run the compiler that prints the scanner and
parser roundtrip, which scans and parse input text (program) to structured AST
and pretty-prints back to strings.
