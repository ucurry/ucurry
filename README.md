# The Âµcurry Compiler

Coded in OCaml, this compiler takes a minimal functional language and compiles 
it down to LLVM IR. The compiler now only supports scanning and parsing.

## How to compile and execute

In the toplevel directory, run `dune exec ucurry`

<!--
 A README describing how to compile and execute your compiler (as it stands), how to run your test script, any syntax that you still need to add to your compiler, and the names and email addresses of all group members. If your compiler requires any packages on top of what MicroC requires to be run, instructions on which packages to install and how to install them must be included in the README.
